This repository contains the resources for [Jeremy Whitlock's](https://github.com/whitlockjc)
*Design Driven APIs with Node.js and Swagger* session at [I Love APIs 2105](http://iloveapis.com/).  This session did
not have any code so only the slides are included in this project.

If you were looking for the similarly named workshop *(Design-First API Development Using Node.js and Swagger)*, please
visit [https://github.com/iloveapis2015/design-first-api](https://github.com/iloveapis2015/design-first-api).

We hope you enjoyed the session and please do not hesitate for any help.
